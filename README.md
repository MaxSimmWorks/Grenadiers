# Grenadiers
A mod for RimWorld that lets a pawn operate a grenadier carbine, switching between rifle and grenade launcher.

Notes to self:

1. The default should be rifle mode.
2. When a pawn is drafted, the player should have the option to switch to grenade launcher mode.
3. Multiple pawns with grenadier carbines should have the option to switch back and forth as an entire unit.
4. To make it easy for players to see which mode their pawns are in, rather than have the buttons use the checkmark method, the UI button should swap between rifle indicator and grenade launcher indicator as one button.
5. The tags for the grenade launcher and the grenades should be in the same XML file so other modders can easily add or make their own grenadier rifles.
6. Ideally this should be compatable with CE, but if it isn't, no big deal.
